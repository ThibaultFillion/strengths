Example 1
=========

The folder contains the simulation script for the first example of the paper.
It contains the following files :
*  README.rst : This file.
*  cg_map.txt : Coarse graining map utilized for this example.
*  environments.txt : Layout of the environment associated with each cell of the system
*  system.json : JSON description of the reaction-diffusion system, loaded by the example.
*  script.py : Simulation script for the non coarse-grained simulations.
*  script_cg.py : Simulation script for the coarse-grained simulations.
*  results.py : Script plotting the output generated by the two simulation scripts.

To run this example, first step is to run script.py and script_cg.py in the directory.
Those will output JSON and NumPy files inside the folder. Second and last step is to run results.py, which will plot the results using Matplotlib.

Note: the original results (featured in the paper) were generated with an early version of the package and of those script files,
and some files were renamed. The instruction

.. code:: python

  "tlpcgucg = strncg.uncoarsegrain_trajectory(tlpcg, tlp.system.space, cgmap)"

(results.py, l.52) was replaced by

.. code:: python

  "tlpcgucg = strncg.uncoarsegrain_trajectory(tlpcg, tlp.system, cgmap)"

due to an API change. Also, doing the coarse-graining by hand as in the script files is not necessary
anymore, as the coarse-graining map can simply be passed as an argument to the simulate function.

Reaction kinetic parameters are guessed.
Diffusion parameters are set by order of magnitude from
references [1] and [2], as explained in the paper :
*R* and *C* are supposed to be membrane receptors, and their diffusion
coefficients are thus set in the order of magnitude of that of a transmembrane
protein diffusing in a compartmented plasma membrane [2].
*L* may me a small protein, thus its diffusion coefficient is set to that of a
protein of about 30 kDa diffusing in water [1].
*X* and *Y* are also proteins, but diffuse inside inside of the cell, thus
their diffusion coefficients are set to that of a protein of about 30 kDa
diffusing in cytosol [1].
