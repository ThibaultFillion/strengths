Dependencies
============

Strengths relies on a few external packages.

NumPy
-----

A lot of Strengths's features and classes, such as the UnitArray class, rely on the `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_ package and especially its array type `ndarray <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html>`_. As a consequence, Strengths requires NumPy to be installed. You can refer to `NumPy's website <https://numpy.org/install/>`_ for more information on how to install NumPy.

Matplotlib
----------

Strengths provides some functions facilitating the visualization of simulation data with the strengths.plot submodule.
Those functions rely on the `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_ package, which provides valuable tools for plotting.
If you want to use the strengths.plot utility, you'll need to have Matplotlib installed.
You can refer to `Matplotlib's website <https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html>`_ for more information on Matplotlib.
